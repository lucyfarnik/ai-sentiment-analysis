We still don't know what happened to the beautiful people of 2023. We have video and photographic  records that they existed and thrived. In fact, most everyone of that generation was considered beautiful.

 The mystery deepened recently with the approval of archeologists exhuming remains from that period. Upon scanning these remains, archeologists have found that only plain looking people were buried.

Were the beautiful people enshrined elsewhere? Or was it considered gods too beautiful to bury or even demons that had to be desecrated? Were they aliens that arrived by the stellar balloons of that time?",1440,jb0lfnd,7,social media face filters vs AI filter,Damnthatsinteresting

Completely unrealistic to expect this to happen. Safe to say many of these signatories - while they may have good intentions at heart - are living in a dreamland if they think firms like Google or Microsoft are going to even remotely slow down on this generative AI hype train.

From the article: Generative artificial intelligence systems could lead to ""significant disruption"" in the labor market and affect around 300 million full-time jobs globally, according to new research from Goldman Sachs.

Generative AI, a type of artificial intelligence that is capable of generating text or other content in response to user prompts, has exploded in popularity in recent months following the launch to the public of OpenAI's ChatGPT. The buzzy chatbot quickly went viral with users and appeared to prompt several other tech companies to launch their own AI systems.

Based on an analysis of data on occupational tasks in both the US and Europe, Goldman researchers extrapolated their findings and estimated that generative AI could expose 300 million full-time jobs around the world to automation if it lives up to its promised capabilities.

The report, written by Joseph Briggs and Devesh Kodnani, said that roughly two-thirds of current jobs are exposed to some degree of AI automation while generative AI could substitute up to a quarter of current work.

White-collar workers are some of the most likely to be affected by new AI tools. The Goldman report highlighted US legal workers and administrative staff as particularly at risk from the new tech. An earlier study from researchers at Princeton University, the University of Pennsylvania, and New York University, also estimated legal services as the industry most likely to be affected by technology like ChatGPT.

Manav Raj, one of the authors of the study, and an Assistant Professor of Management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, told Insider this was because the legal services industry was made up of a relatively small number of occupations that were already highly exposed to AI automation.
