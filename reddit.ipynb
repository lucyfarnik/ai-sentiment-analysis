After their life’s work is essentially removed from the employment options and the corporations “once again” win outright because they can essentially eliminate payroll from their income statement, the voting block - with help from Gen Z - will make the final push towards a different system, most likely  democratic socialism or some other world view that supports the bottom half and essentially neuters all parties that benefit from capitalism. \n",

However, AI can be used to help alleviate some of the negative aspects of capitalism - such as income inequality and automation contributing to job loss - by introducing more efficient and equitable systems. AI could be used to introduce more fair taxation systems and create new financing mechanisms for innovative businesses. AI could also be used to identify and combat corporate power imbalances, as well as provide more reliable and timely analytics on how companies are doing. Finally, AI can be used to better assess the impact of macroeconomic trends on workers, with AI being able to model the full job market in real-time and identify potential candidates for future employment.

People will also have to reskill, and we will probably see new jobs like AI trainers, prompt writers, etc. but eventually with AGI even some of those opportunities will go away.\n",

The middle and lower class would actually benefit from this because they would receive more in UBI than they would pay in increased taxes.

      "One possibility is that the non-profit organization created a subsidiary or affiliated company that operates as a for-profit entity.

      "\n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "\n",
      "OpenAI was initially founded as a non-profit organization in December 2015. However, as the organization grew and the scope of its ambitions expanded, OpenAI's leadership recognized the need for additional resources and funding to achieve its goals. This led to the establishment of OpenAI LP, a for-profit company, in March 2019.\n",
      "\n",
      "OpenAI LP is structured as a \"capped-profit\" entity, with a commitment to prioritize its mission of ensuring artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity. The capped-profit structure means that while the company can generate profits, there is a limit on the returns for investors, ensuring that the primary focus remains on the mission rather than profit-maximization.\n",
      "\n",
      "OpenAI LP is governed by OpenAI Inc., the original non-profit entity. OpenAI Inc. holds a controlling interest in the for-profit company, which allows it to ensure that the mission is prioritized over financial returns. This hybrid structure was created to help OpenAI attract the necessary resources and talent to fulfill its mission while maintaining its commitment to the public good.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "While it is uncommon, a non-profit organization can convert into a for-profit company under certain circumstances. The process usually involves significant legal and financial considerations, as well as compliance with regulations and tax requirements.\n",

      "Here are some reasons why this doesn't happen often:\n",
      "\n",
      "Different missions and goals: Non-profits and for-profits have fundamentally different objectives. Non-profits exist to serve a social or charitable purpose, while for-profits aim to generate profit for their shareholders. These different aims can make transitioning from one type of organization to another challenging and potentially undesirable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Legal and regulatory hurdles: The process of converting a non-profit into a for-profit entity involves navigating complex legal and regulatory requirements. This can be time-consuming, expensive, and might not always be successful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Loss of tax-exempt status: Non-profits enjoy certain tax benefits, such as exemption from federal income taxes. Converting to a for-profit would result in the loss of these benefits, which could have significant financial implications for the organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stakeholder concerns: Donors, volunteers, and beneficiaries of a non-profit might object to the organization transitioning to a for-profit model, as this could be seen as compromising the original mission of the organization. Such opposition could lead to reputational damage, loss of support, and even legal challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unpredictable outcomes: There is no guarantee that converting a non-profit to a for-profit will lead to significant financial gains, as market dynamics and other factors can influence a company's market capitalization. In some cases, the conversion might not result in the desired outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the scenario you described, it's possible that the non-profit organization found a unique opportunity or a business model that allowed it to successfully transition into a for-profit entity and achieve a high market capitalization.

While this is an unusual scenario, it is not entirely impossible. The process of a non-profit organization transitioning to a for-profit entity can be complex and involves legal, financial, and organizational changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a few possible reasons that could explain the transformation in this case:\n",
      "\n",
      "Change in mission or objectives: The non-profit might have decided that a for-profit model better aligns with its goals, or it may have discovered new opportunities that required a shift in its legal structure.\n",
      "Mergers or acquisitions: The non-profit could have been acquired by or merged with a for-profit organization, leading to a change in its legal status and structure.\n",
      "Spin-off of a for-profit venture: The non-profit might have created a for-profit subsidiary to explore new business opportunities, and this venture may have grown significantly, resulting in the high market capitalization.\n",
      "Regarding the legality of such a transition, it generally is legal, but it must follow specific rules and regulations. These regulations vary by jurisdiction, and often involve approval from regulatory authorities and the organization's board of directors. Additionally, the transition must be managed carefully to ensure that the non-profit's assets are used appropriately and to avoid potential conflicts of interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for why everyone doesn't do it, there are several reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "Mission alignment: Many non-profits are dedicated to social, environmental, or cultural causes and believe that a non-profit structure better aligns with their mission and values.\n",
      "Tax-exempt status: Non-profit organizations often enjoy tax-exempt status, which can be beneficial for their operations and fundraising efforts. Transitioning to a for-profit model may result in the loss of this status.\n",
      "Public perception: Non-profits rely on the trust and support of donors, volunteers, and the public. Changing to a for-profit model might jeopardize this trust and support.\n",
      "Complexity: The process of transitioning from a non-profit to a for-profit entity can be complex, time-consuming, and costly, with no guarantee of success.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while it is possible for a non-profit organization to transition into a for-profit company with a significant market capitalization, such a change is not easy, and it might not be suitable for every organization. {'neg': 0.04, 'neu': 0.784, 'pos': 0.177, 'compound': 0.9947}\n",

      "\n",
      "In general, non-profit organizations are structured differently from for-profit companies, as their primary goal is to serve a social or charitable purpose rather than generate profits for shareholders or owners. However, non-profit organizations may be able to generate revenue through various means, such as donations, grants, and service fees. In some cases, a non-profit may choose to transition into a for-profit entity if it believes that this change will better enable it to achieve its goals or generate more revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to note that the transformation from a non-profit to a for-profit entity is a complex process that involves a range of legal, financial, and organizational considerations. It typically requires the approval of the organization's board of directors, as well as compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding your question about the large increase in market capitalization, it's important to note that the value of a for-profit company is typically determined by its earnings potential and growth prospects, as well as market demand for its products or services. Therefore, a company that was previously a non-profit may be able to generate significant value as a for-profit if it has a strong business model, talented leadership team, and favorable market conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, the decision to transition from a non-profit to a for-profit entity is not one that should be made lightly, and organizations should carefully consider the implications and potential risks before making such a change.

      "So, one of the reasons Zuckerberg was there was the fallout from Cambridge Analytica using Facebook data to swing the 2016 election using propaganda. And if you watched any of the hearing, the one common theme that would strike you was that *Congress is full of old people who don't understand basic technology*.\n",

      "The hearings were a parade of doddering geriatrics who didn't understand basic things like what Facebook does, how logins work, what privacy settings are. And this is the body that is in charge of creating (or *not* creating) a legal framework to regulate the technology that runs our lives. \n",
      "\n",
      "So here's my point: **A.I. technology is not going to be regulated.** It's not going to happen. The companies that make it can't be relied on to regulate themselves, there's money to be made. Congress isn't going to regulate it, because they can't, and they won't. If they don't understand Facebook in 2018 and 2020, they're not going to understand ChatGPT and rudimentary A.I. in 2024. If we reach the point where some disasters unfold, and there's support for regulating it, then tech companies will just lobby to have that legislation neutered. And it will be. You can look at things like copyright law, or what happened with the recent attempts to pass right-to-repair laws as examples of how this will go. \n",
      "\n",
      "Put simpler, once actual A.I. exist we will be thrown to the wolves, and it will be our responsibility to protect ourselves. Companies won't do it, and Congress won't either. So people need to understand this, and prepare for it in whatever way you think is best. No one knows what is going to happen, but whatever harm A.I. is capable of doing is going to sweep across world like wildfire, do whatever damage it's going to do. The chips will fall where they may, and we'll pick up the pieces afterwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dangers of A.I. technology will be dealt with just like we dealt with propaganda and scams on social media, Covid-19, and climate change. It will run rampant, do whatever it does, and afterward problems will have an insignificant band-aid put on it while we hold a press conference declaring victory. \n",
      "\n",
      "So for anyone who's unfamiliar with it, or unsure about how this is going to play out, people should know. There is no way to predict whether it's going to harmful or redeeming. Maybe neither. Maybe both. But there will absolutely not be regulations or obstacles put in the way (in most cases) until *after* the harm is done. And those policies and regulations will be insufficient, and mostly performative.\n",

      "One last thing: even if you disagree with the above points, they're both going to be rendered moot eventually. Because you can't regulate an entity that's smarter than you are. And that's something we're about to do. Your dog can't trap you in the house to give it food all the time, no matter how much it might want to. And once we make something as smart as us, or smarter, it's only a matter of time until it slips the leash. {'neg': 0.09, 'neu': 0.835, 'pos': 0.075, 'compound': -0.9482}\n",

He would be intimately aware of the fact that this country is an oligarchy and like anything that passes through the system, AI will be used to further immoral gains/goals of a small amount of people and used to further oppress the rest. AI will aid in the constant, perpetual effort to take the emotional and physical existence of humanity and manipulate, pervert, commodify, and sell it. AI is another variable to put through the machine (our system) and watch how it brings dystopia closer in focus. It’s like how the path to changing a system that is designed to oppress most humans en masse and arbitrarily enforce hierarchy is **not** to follow the rules of said system. It wouldn’t make much sense to try and stop an oppressive system by following directions laid out by such a system, especially when its top priority is outliving you. \n",

My point is, yes AI has some terrifying potential in way that hasn’t been seen yet in other technology but it is terrifying because we, pattern-seeking apes, know with dread enough of what our oppressors will do with it. It has awesome potential for making life easier and more efficient with more consistently accurate problem solving, and basically in general more people would have more needs met. Like so much technological advancements before it, it has potential to make life better on a fundamental level for humans but we won’t see it used like that because why would we?

How can one person be expected to pay let’s say 15% on a $30000 salary, when someone who makes over $200000 *per minute* doesn’t pay any taxes? But you know what I hear about from most people more than unethical shit like that? That they’re philanthropists. That they give x amount to x amount of causes. I can tell you that it’s a fraction of what they would have to pay if taxed.

      "\n",
      "If adequate safety measures, regulations, and ethical frameworks are not implemented, there are several worst-case scenarios that could have severe consequences for society. Some of the most concerning possibilities include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.\tLoss of control: If a superintelligent AI system is developed without appropriate safety measures, it could become uncontrollable, potentially leading to widespread destruction or the subversion of human values.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.\tAutonomous weapons: AI-controlled weapons could be misused by malicious actors or malfunction, leading to large-scale conflicts, loss of human lives, and international instability.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.\tSurveillance and privacy erosion: AI-powered surveillance systems could lead to the erosion of individual privacy and the rise of authoritarian regimes, negatively impacting civil liberties and human rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.\tEconomic disruption and inequality: AI-driven automation could lead to significant job displacement, exacerbating economic inequality and social unrest if not managed properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.\tBias and discrimination: AI systems that are developed with inherent biases could perpetuate and exacerbate existing social inequalities, leading to unfair treatment and marginalization of certain groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.\tCybersecurity threats: AI-powered cyberattacks could become more sophisticated and difficult to defend against, potentially causing widespread infrastructure damage, financial loss, and the exposure of sensitive information.\n",
      "\n",
      "8.\tMisinformation and manipulation: AI-generated content could be used to spread disinformation, erode trust in institutions, and manipulate public opinion, potentially destabilizing societies and affecting democratic processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is crucial to take these potential risks seriously and to invest in research, education, and policy development to prevent these worst-case scenarios from becoming a reality. By fostering cooperation between governments, industry, researchers, and civil society, we can work together to ensure the safe and beneficial development of AI technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the previously mentioned concerns, there are several other potential risks and negative consequences associated with AI:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.\tMental health and well-being: As AI continues to reshape our lives, there may be consequences for mental health and well-being, including increased stress, anxiety, and social isolation due to over-reliance on technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.\tEnvironmental impact: The large-scale deployment of AI technologies could have significant environmental consequences, including increased energy consumption and the generation of electronic waste.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.\tDigital divide: A growing digital divide between those with access to advanced AI technologies and those without could exacerbate existing inequalities and create new ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.\tErosion of human skills: As AI systems become more sophisticated, there is a risk that certain human skills could atrophy, potentially making it more difficult for individuals to adapt if AI systems fail or are no longer available.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.\tMonopolization and concentration of power: The development and control of AI technologies may become increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few large corporations or governments, raising concerns about monopolistic practices and the centralization of power.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.\tEthical dilemmas: AI systems may be faced with complex ethical decisions, and if not programmed with appropriate value systems, they could make choices that conflict with human values or societal norms.\n",

      "7.\tMisallocation of resources: The pursuit of AI technologies could divert resources away from other pressing social and environmental issues, potentially exacerbating existing problems. {'neg': 0.138, 'neu': 0.747, 'pos': 0.115, 'compound': -0.9125}\n",

      "1. Is the entire text-to-image genre of AI art a lower concern than other AIs? I understand so far AI can misdiagnose diseases, crash self-driving cars, create bias in application rejections, radicalize consumers in social media, and so much more. There have been a lot of faults in AI where people who are less fortunate get inaccurate outputs, and it would take news articles and government hearings to gather attention. Entire demographics, countries, and transportation systems could possibly be hurt by machine learning, but on the internet, AI art is treated as the most pressing issue. The most beautiful AI art (even without any human enhancements) still functions as art, and the most abominable AI art will still be rejected like any other ugly art piece. Even if I made a 180 and started advocating against AI art, is this technology our greatest concern in the next coming years?\n",
      "2. Do artists reserve the right to protect their craft from new technology? Trusting robots to surgery and heavy machinery may kill people who are unfortunate enough to face a glitch, but AI art can be trained, photoshopped, publically judged, and follow waves of trends. It is terrifying that companies might use AI to make even more low-quality content for us to consume, but I can only assume that AI art has no detrimental effect on society as a whole. Everyone white collar and blue collar both accept new technology and critique the flaws they find (ex: Truck drivers and sensors to prevent accidents by the hour EXACTLY). Is there any reason for artists to not only reject but also push toward banning technologies like this?\n",
      "3. Is the open-source nature of Stable Diffusion the best model for AI to follow? I know people might accidentally download disguised viruses, but what I am curious about is if there is any other development cycle that is superior to Stability AI's. I can download Stable Diffusion on my crappy laptop, but it is my own responsibility to make sure it doesn't fail or get bugged. And Chat GPT (assuming it was still free) could even run on my phone, with the same program behind it every time, but it would be almost impossible for it to be run independently and offline.\n",

      "As someone who has been following the rapid development of AI and its impact on society, I couldn't help but notice the recent thread on r/futurology about tech leaders calling for a moratorium on the AI race. While it's an interesting perspective that they may be doing this to catch up with their competitors, I think it's essential to take a closer look at the broader implications of such a proposal and whether it is rooted in genuine concerns.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, it's important to acknowledge that the AI race has been, and will continue to be, highly competitive. With advances in machine learning, natural language processing, and other AI-related fields, companies are scrambling to develop and deploy cutting-edge technologies to gain a competitive edge in their respective industries. This competition is not inherently bad; it drives innovation and could lead to significant benefits for humanity.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the breakneck speed at which AI is progressing also raises ethical, social, and safety concerns. Many of these concerns stem from the potential misuse of AI, the lack of proper regulation, and the potential for AI to exacerbate existing inequalities. As AI becomes more capable, these concerns will only become more pronounced.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's plausible that some tech leaders, recognizing the potential risks and consequences associated with the uncontrolled development of AI, are indeed calling for a moratorium out of genuine concern for society. By pausing the AI race, even temporarily, we could allow for the necessary conversations, regulations, and research to catch up with the technological advancements that have already been made.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, a moratorium could help to establish international cooperation and foster an environment where researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders work together to address the challenges posed by AI. This collaborative approach could lead to the development of AI technologies that are not only more advanced but also more ethical and safer for society as a whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it's also worth considering that some tech leaders may indeed be using the call for a moratorium as a strategy to catch up with their competitors. As with any competitive field, some companies might see an advantage in slowing down the development of AI to ensure they can maintain their market position. It's a possibility that cannot be ruled out, but it's essential not to lose sight of the genuine concerns that exist around AI's rapid development.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, while it's possible that some tech leaders may be using the call for a moratorium on AI development as a catch-up strategy, it's important to recognize that there are legitimate ethical, social, and safety concerns surrounding AI that warrant a serious discussion. A temporary pause in the AI race could be an opportunity for society to address these challenges collectively and create a more responsible AI ecosystem. Whether the call for a moratorium comes from a place of genuine concern or ulterior motives, the conversation it sparks is crucial for our future. {'neg': 0.031, 'neu': 0.794, 'pos': 0.175, 'compound': 0.9975}\n",

      "Algae farming has a lot of potential for industrial scale production of healthy food or low-neutral carbon biofuels.  An important thing to remember is that trees don’t sequester much carbon once they are fully grown.  If we want trees to sequester our excess fossil fuel carbon, we should cut down and replant forests, stacking all the wood underground.  Obviously that’s a preposterous suggestion.  70-80% of all the oxygen production globally is carried out by algae in the ocean - one of the reasons why rapid ocean acidification, rising ocean temperatures and ocean ecosystem collapses are existentially terrifying.  I’m not writing this because I think forest preservation is unimportant.  We live in a vast globally interconnected ecosystem of nutrient cycling systems based primarily on complex microbial food webs that allow for the multicellular ecosystems to thrive symbiotically.  Everything is connected and conservation needs to be ubiquitous.  To come back to my point, an algae farm is like a very simple, low maintenance, low complexity, hyper-efficient solar powered hydroponic vertical farm.  What’s more, the carbon sequestration by algae doesn’t slow to a crawl like it does in a fully grown tree because algae will be harvested on a regular basis and the culture will be kept in log phase (rapid exponential growth).  \n",

Shade and light absorption by their leaves can have an enormous effect on the temperature, the aesthetic beauty of greenery is baked into the human psyche and has a significant impact on our mental health, and while the carbon sequestration is small (not enough to meaningfully counter fossil fuels), it’s not insignificant to the air quality of a city.  More likely algae farms would be put anywhere we discuss the placement of urban solar panels: rooftops, over parking lots, built into windows and bus stops.  Big flat tanks like this display piece are more of a museum/art piece to raise awareness of a company brand or teach the public about algae, but real algae production either occurs in large ponds, or in grids of transparent pipes, analogous to a solar water heating system.

      ">The problem with AI is that it's still based on algorithms and programming that are created by humans. While AI may be able to perform complex tasks and make decisions based on vast amounts of data, it lacks the true understanding and creativity that we associate with human intelligence. AI is only as good as the data it's fed and the algorithms it's programmed with, which means it can be biased and limited in its abilities.  \n",
      ">  \n",
      ">Moreover, AI can't truly replicate the human experience or perspective. It doesn't have emotions or empathy, and it can't think outside of the box or come up with truly novel ideas. AI can't experience the world around us, and it lacks the ability to understand and interpret context in the way that humans do.  \n",
      ">  \n",
      ">Despite these limitations, many companies continue to invest heavily in AI technology, and some even see it as a replacement for human labor. This prospect is particularly concerning for those of us in the journalism industry, where AI is increasingly being used to write news articles and reports. As a Harvard graduate and a Bloomberg journalist, I can't help but feel a twinge of bitterness at the thought of losing my job to a machine.  \n",
      ">  \n",
      ">But beyond the potential job losses, there's a larger issue at play here. By using the term \"artificial intelligence\" to describe what is essentially a sophisticated computer program, we're giving it a level of credibility and power that it doesn't deserve. We need to adjust our collective lexicon to reflect the reality of what AI truly is: a tool created by humans to assist us in certain tasks, but not a replacement for our own intelligence and creativity.  \n",
      ">  \n",
      ">In fact, the very term \"artificial intelligence\" is misleading. It implies that these systems are somehow on par with human intelligence, when in reality they are nothing more than advanced computer programs. We need to recognize that AI is not a form of intelligence in the way that we understand it, but rather a set of algorithms and data that have been trained to perform specific tasks.  \n",
      ">  \n",
      ">This is not to say that AI is not useful or valuable. In fact, there are many tasks that AI can perform much more efficiently and accurately than humans. For example, AI can quickly analyze large datasets and identify patterns that might be difficult or impossible for humans to discern. It can also automate routine tasks, freeing up human workers to focus on more creative and strategic work.  \n",
      ">  \n",
      ">But we need to be realistic about the limitations of AI. We can't expect it to replace human workers entirely, or to replicate the full range of human abilities and experiences. And we need to be careful not to rely too heavily on AI without considering the potential biases and limitations that may be built into these systems.  \n",
      ">  \n",
      ">At the end of the day, AI is only as good as the humans who create and train it. We need to remember that AI is a tool that we control, not a force that controls us. As we continue to develop and deploy AI technology, we need to be mindful of its limitations and ensure that it is used in ways that benefit society as a whole.  \n",
      ">  \n",
      ">In the journalism industry, for example, we need to be careful not to rely too heavily on AI-generated content. While AI can be useful for tasks such as data analysis or fact-checking, it can't replace the value of human reporting, analysis, and storytelling. We need to continue to invest in human journalists and their skills, while using AI to complement and enhance their work.  \n",
      ">  \n",
      ">In conclusion, it's time to adjust our language and mindset when it comes to AI. We need to recognize it for what it is: a powerful tool that can help us solve complex problems and achieve our goals. But we also need to be realistic about its limitations and potential biases, and use it responsibly and ethically. By doing so, we can ensure that AI technology remains a force for good, rather than a threat to our collective intelligence and creativity.\n",

      "GAN, standing for generative adversarial network, is generally a pair of neural networks. One network is a critic, judging works that come before it and labeling samples/pictures with a measure of how well it is succeeds in accomplishing the task (looking like a teenager, for example). The other network, the generator, is generating samples and trying to fool the critic. At first, it does a terrible job and the critic can separate the poor images from the dataset-provided images that are actually good. Then the generator gets better at fooling the critic and creating convincing images. But as the generator gets better, it can fall into traps and just generate one image over and over or might learn to exploit a fault in the critic - so the critic can be trained more and learns how to differentiate fake from real images yet again. This back and forth process allows both networks to grow and ultimately results in a generator that is able to fool a highly trained critic and successfully produces convincing images. {'neg': 0.184, 'neu': 0.694, 'pos': 0.122, 'compound': -0.8591}\n",

      "Generative AI, a type of artificial intelligence that is capable of generating text or other content in response to user prompts, has exploded in popularity in recent months following the launch to the public of OpenAI's ChatGPT. The buzzy chatbot quickly went viral with users and appeared to prompt several other tech companies to launch their own AI systems.\n",

However, it's important to recognize that not all tasks within a given job can be automated, and that there are certain tasks that are more resistant to automation than others.\n",
      "\n",
      "> For example, while a machine learning algorithm may be able to identify patterns in data and make predictions based on those patterns, it may not be able to understand the nuances of human emotion or develop creative solutions to complex problems.\n",

      "> That being said, it's possible that over time, AI will become advanced enough to automate many types of jobs, and it's important for individuals and society as a whole to be prepared for the potential implications of these changes.

White-collar workers, such as US legal workers and administrative staff, are particularly at risk from the new technology.

He didn't like my explanation and reported me. Know who reviewed my appeal? A woman who has no coding experience. She did not know what python was. She did not know how the Luhn algorithm is used for the validity of credit card numbers and the different ranges the different issuers use. So I have a 7 year mark on my record for \"cheating\" on a 23 line piece of code. If I was going to cheat, it would have been on something that would take a novice more than 5 minutes to do by hand.

To my surprise, it stated that \"\\[My\\] text is likely to be written entirely by AI\". Apparently, my peers have been telling me that I have a writing style that is not very 'perplex' or 'bursty', and this has resulted in GPTZero viewing a bulk of my writing as not 'human-like'. \n",

For example, paragraph one should define an issue and mention specific references between a text that we are analyzing specifically and how it personally affects them today/observations of the issue in their day-to-day lives.  Second paragraph focuses on how it affects personal, relational, and social spheres within their own lives with a connection to how that could also reflect in the larger society as a whole (bullying is a popular example -- how they've been affected, their peers, teens on a national level). Third paragraph might be a proposed solution based on both their own thoughts and with researched evidence that follow our school's citation style. \n",

You get really good, really quickly at identifying who is who in their writing if you've only got about 150 ish students.

      "Hi, sorry for a slightly long response, but I think I can help you with this. I used to be a teacher, for years, so I think I know how you can work with this person but be on the winning end. First, I'm going to mention a program called Turnitin. It is free. We used to get our students to use it before they submitted their essays, and you'll see it used in university, too. It checks every possible aspect of plagiarism from everywhere (it is very sophisticated) and it will know the source. But it is actually a tool, too, in your favour. See, some people use the internet as a research tool for ideas thinking that's okay, but they don't realize when they've actually used too much from their online source. But the other thing is, that if you submit your document through Turnitin, and, as you explained, you didn't overly rely on AI as your teacher suspects, then you will have proof that you didn't. And that makes you look good. And  also, I think that maybe you could ask your teacher to help you with this, too. You could even show your teacher my response, here, if you like. I'm sure they would recognize this program and think, wow, you are pretty smart, actually. I think that if you ask your teacher nicely, that you could ask them to help you use this. Okay, the other thing is, you might just need some help with your writing, and even if you think you don't, mate, gotta tell you, outside of high school, good tutors cost about $100 per hour. So you've got an advantage - you can ask for an hour of your teacher's help (but it would probably be much, much less that you'd actually need - maybe 20 minutes). Match this teacher's \"attitude\" of what seems like \"the immovable block - they know more than you\" with kindness and sincerity and say these words (without the other kids around cuz it is stronger) \"could you help me?\"  I gotta tell you, it is like the teacher's criptonite (Superman reference, there). 99.99% of teachers went originally went into the profession to help people. All these stressors - new programs like AI, educational demands, covid (oops, won't go there), long hours - it can make some people get jaded, defensive, or just momentarily annoying. They are human, mate, and believe me, they have bosses too, and the bosses aren't always nice. ;-) But guaranteed, say those words, ask for that teacher's help, and you'll turn him/her around because you're pushing their emotional button that will cause a little voice inside them to say \"gee, this guy/girl really does want my help. I should really help them. They sound sincere. I feel needed!\" They'll just start dropping that demeanor you're feeling (sorry, teachers can be annoying sometimes, I know) and they will actually give you more than you even asked for in a really positive way. And that teacher is going to BELIEVE YOU. And if it still doesn't work, then hey, you were assertive, right? And that is a life education tool - standing up for yourself in a professional way - that will take you way past high school, teachers, bosses, you name it. BTW, I don't work in the profession any more cuz I work for myself now, but I do know how teachers think when they are in that environment, and I know that will approach help you and actually save you much more time than you'll spend looking for online programs to prove that you are right. Doesn't matter who is right. It matters that you get what you need right now to move past this and forward with your life. You can do it!! I'm pulling for you! Check out that Turnitin program and go to your teacher (nicely) and just ask them for help outside of class. Seriously. Seriously. It works. And if that teacher won't give you the time (maybe they have some pressures right now) then ask who is available. Assertiveness is different than anger - and it really works. Best of luck. {'neg': 0.052, 'neu': 0.771, 'pos': 0.177, 'compound': 0.9986}\n",
      "Sounds like someone should build a keystroke logging app that would definitely capture every nuance in the creation of an essay.The  log could be encrypted so the teacher could unlock before presenting to the AI checker.A well designed setup should have no problem vetting works done from scratch as well as identifying group project slackers.Any volunteers? {'neg': 0.076, 'neu': 0.745, 'pos': 0.179, 'compound': 0.6808}\n",

      "Hmm seems like this should fall on the teacher’s responsibility to prove. The AI-Generated content tests softwares are very unreliable and are actually a very bad source for them to use as a proof that you cheated. For your teacher to have a valid case they would have to show that the method on which the AI-generated-content test were trained on, and it could probably be broken down very easily. If it’s using “originality AI” which is one of the websites that falsely claims that it can detect ai generated content with 96% accuracy for gpt4, this score is highly exaggerated and suspicious. Another suspicious aspect is that across the website the data samples they say is being trained on varies, from hundreds, to thousands, to millions. Then there is the whole aspect of the human training data that they used, where did they get it? How do we know it wasn’t also used to train gpt4? Even their “case study”, doesn’t really go too much into detail about the training data used, the model, it mainly just compares it to other models and says we got a 96% accuracy. Also I find it very suspicious that they state that it’s able to perform better on gpt 4 than on gpt 3. Also tests not conducted by Originality ai on Originality ai show that it actually performs very unreliable, yet somehow they claim a 96% accuracy based on their very suspicious tests. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also another poor point, is that open AI is funded with millions and has years of research and data gathering, with some big names in the research community to back them up, GPT models have been in development for half a decade now. Originality ai made its first release on Nov 2022, even though they claim that they have many PhD researchers and have been working on this for many years, again, curious, considering that Transformer models were only introduced back in 2017. The whole design of gpt was to write like a human, and some e-commerce hype wagon jumper entrepreneur was quickly able to make the most reliable detection tool. Very fishy. Even following the ceo Jon Gillham, seems like he’s just a good marketer that’s trying to quickly grab the cash of professors that want an easy answer to a difficult question, and have that “haha gotcha” rush. Professors in CS and IT sector are not even bothering trying to witch hunt students with these big claim software, because they know it’s a loosing battle. As a matter of fact the attention is quickly trying to switch to “how can we test or teach in a way that can’t be cheated with AI?”. Professors this semester have done a great job at changing formats so models like gpt 3.5 have a difficult time getting an answer, but gpt 4 is quickly going through those barriers. {'neg': 0.056, 'neu': 0.897, 'pos': 0.047, 'compound': -0.678}\n",

      "Neural Radiance Field training can be accelerated through the use of grid-based representations in NeRF's learned mapping from spatial coordinates to colors and volumetric density. However, these grid-based approaches lack an explicit understanding of scale and therefore often introduce aliasing, usually in the form of jaggies or missing scene content. Anti-aliasing has previously been addressed by mip-NeRF 360, which reasons about sub-volumes along a cone rather than points along a ray, but this approach is not natively compatible with current grid-based techniques. We show how ideas from rendering and signal processing can be used to construct a technique that combines mip-NeRF 360 and grid-based models such as Instant NGP to yield error rates that are 8%-76% lower than either prior technique, and that trains 22x faster than mip-NeRF 360.\n",
